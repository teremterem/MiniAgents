"""
Sequence Flattening Example for MiniAgents

This example demonstrates the concept of "sequence flattening" in MiniAgents, which is one
of the framework's central features. Sequence flattening automatically resolves complex
hierarchical structures of messages, promises, and collections into flat, uniform sequences
of message promises in the background.

The example mimics the structure of the web_research.py example but uses dummy messages
instead of real web searches, scraping, and LLM calls to focus on the sequence flattening concept.

    All of these different message types and sources get automatically flattened into
    a single, uniform sequence of messages that can be consumed by the caller.
