# MiniAgents: Multi-Agent AI With Procedural Simplicity

![MiniAgents on Mars](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/raw/main/images/banner-miniagents-2025-04-27.jpeg)

An open-source, async-first Python framework for building multi-agent AI systems with an innovative approach to parallelism, so you can focus on creating intelligent agents, not on managing the concurrency of your flows.

To install MiniAgents run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U miniagents
```

The source code of the project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents).

## Why MiniAgents

1. **Write procedural code, get parallel execution:** Unlike graph-based frameworks that force you to think in nodes and edges, MiniAgents lets you write straightforward sequential code while the framework handles the complexities of parallel execution for agent interactions automatically. Your code stays clear and readable.

2. **Nothing blocks until it's needed:** With its innovative promise-based architecture, agents execute in parallel. Execution only blocks at points where specific agent messages are actively awaited. Agents communicate through ***replayable promises of message sequences***, not just concrete messages or single-pass async generators. This replayability is a key distinction, allowing message streams to be consumed multiple times by different agents or for different purposes, fostering flexible data flows and enabling maximum concurrency without complex manual synchronization code.

3. **Immutable message philosophy:** MiniAgents uses immutable, Pydantic-based messages that eliminate race conditions and data corruption concerns. This design choice enables highly parallelized agent execution without many of the common headaches of state management. (While messages themselves are immutable, state can still be maintained across multiple invocations of agents by using forked agent instances, a pattern demonstrated later in this tutorial.)

4. **Fundamental Agent Contract:** Every miniagent adheres to a simple contract: it receives a promise of an input sequence of message promises, arbitrary keyword arguments passed to it (which are all automatically "frozen" unless passed via `non_freezable_kwargs` upon forking an agent, which will be explained later in this tutorial), and in return, it produces a promise of a reply sequence of message promises.

5. **Sequential Appearance, Parallel Reality via Promises:** MiniAgents achieves this seamless blend of procedural style and concurrent execution through one of its core mechanisms: "Message Sequence Flattening". Here is a very simple example (a more complex example will be shown later in this tutorial):

```python
@miniagent
async def aggregator_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    # This looks sequential but all agents start working in parallel
    ctx.reply([
        # All nested sequences here will be asynchronously "flattened" in the background
        # for an outside agent (i.e., the one triggering the `aggregator_agent`), so that
        # when the outside agent consumes the result, it appears as a single, flat sequence
        # of messages.
        "Starting analysis...",
        research_agent.trigger(ctx.message_promises),
        calculation_agent.trigger(ctx.message_promises),
        "Analysis complete!",
    ])
```

In this tutorial we'll build a system that can:

1. Break down a user's question into search queries
2. Execute searches in parallel
3. Analyze the search results to identify relevant web pages
4. Scrape and extract information from those pages
5. Synthesize a comprehensive answer

The animation above demonstrates what the output of this system will look like.

## "Message Sequence Flattening"

Let's start by exploring MiniAgents' central feature - "Message Sequence Flattening". We will explain what this means and how it simplifies building concurrent applications shortly. For this, we will build the first, dummy version of our Web Research System. We will not use the real LLM, we will not do the actual web searching and scraping and we will not create the "Final Answer" agent just yet. For now, we will put `asyncio.sleep()` with random delays to emulate activivity instead. Later in the tutorial, we will replace these delays with real web search, scraping and text generation operations.

### Naive alternative to "Message Sequence Flattening"

First, let's look at how you might approach the problem of orchestrating multiple asynchronous operations (like our dummy agents performing research, web searching, and page scraping) and combining their results using standard Python async generators in a naive way. This will help understand the challenges that MiniAgents solves.

This approach uses standard Python `async def` with `async for ... yield` to simulate how one might try to build a similar system without MiniAgents. The key thing to note here is that this method leads to **sequential execution** of the "agents" (async generators in this case).

The full code for this naive example can be found in [`sequence_flattening_naive_alternative.py`](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/blob/main/examples/sequence_flattening_naive_alternative.py).

Let's look at the core agent definitions and how they are run:

```python
# examples/sequence_flattening_naive_alternative.py
import asyncio
import random
from typing import AsyncGenerator


async def research_agent_naive(question: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
    """
    The main research agent, implemented naively.
    Calls web_search_agent_naive sequentially.
    """
    yield f"RESEARCHING: {question}"

    for i in range(3):
        query = f"query {i+1}"
        # The `async for ... yield` construct processes the generator
        # sequentially. The `web_search_agent_naive` for "query 2" will only
        # start after the one for "query 1" (including all its pretend-scraping)
        # is finished.
        async for item in web_search_agent_naive(search_query=query):
            yield item


async def web_search_agent_naive(search_query: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
    """
    Pretends to perform a web search and trigger scraping.
    Calls page_scraper_agent_naive sequentially.
    """
    yield f"{search_query} - SEARCHING"
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1))
    yield f"{search_query} - SEARCH DONE"

    for i in range(2):
        url = f"https://dummy.com/{search_query.replace(' ', '-')}/page-{i+1}"
        # This leads to sequential execution. The next iteration or yield
        # only happens *after* page_scraper_agent_naive is completely finished.
        async for item in page_scraper_agent_naive(url=url):
            yield item


async def page_scraper_agent_naive(url: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
    """
    Pretends to scrape a web page.
    """
    yield f"{url} - SCRAPING"
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1))
    yield f"{url} - DONE"


async def stream_to_stdout_naive(generator: AsyncGenerator[str, None]):
    """
    Consumes the async generator and prints yielded strings.
    """
    i = 0
    async for message in generator:
        i += 1
        print(f"String {i}: {message}")


async def main_naive():
    """
    Main function to trigger the naive research agent and print the results.
    """
    question = "Tell me about MiniAgents sequence flattening (naive version)"
    # Get the async generator
    result_generator = research_agent_naive(question)

    print()
    print("=== Naive Async Generator Execution ===")
    print()

    # Consume and print results sequentially
    await stream_to_stdout_naive(result_generator)

    print()
    print("=== End of Naive Execution ===")
    print()

    print("Attempting to reiterate (WILL YIELD NOTHING):")
    # await asyncio.sleep(0.2)

    # NOTE: Re-iterating a standard async generator like this is not possible.
    # Once consumed, it's exhausted. This contrasts with MiniAgents promises,
    # which are replayable.
    await stream_to_stdout_naive(result_generator)  # This won't print anything

    print("=== End of Reiteration Attempt ===")
    print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main_naive())
```

In `research_agent_naive`, the loop that calls `web_search_agent_naive` processes each "search query" one after the other. The comment inside the loop explicitly points this out: `web_search_agent_naive` for "query 2" will only begin after "query 1" and all its subsequent operations (like page scraping) are entirely finished.

Similarly, `web_search_agent_naive` waits for `page_scraper_agent_naive` to complete for one URL before processing the next. This is because `async for item in sub_generator:` effectively awaits the completion of `sub_generator`'s items sequentially.

Here is what this process looks like as a result:

</p>

To achieve true concurrency with this naive approach, you would need to manually manage `asyncio.create_task` for each sub-operation and potentially use queues or other synchronization primitives to collect and yield results as they become available. This would significantly increase code complexity.

Furthermore, standard async generators, once consumed, are exhausted. If you try to iterate over the `result_generator` in `main_naive` a second time, it will yield nothing. This contrasts with MiniAgents' replayable promises.

This manual management is typical when using raw `asyncio` or even foundational async libraries like `trio` or `anyio`. While these libraries provide powerful concurrency tools, MiniAgents aims to provide a higher-level, agent-centric abstraction for these patterns, particularly around how agents stream and combine their results.

### Real "Message Sequence Flattening" with MiniAgents

Now, let's see how MiniAgents addresses these challenges, enabling concurrent execution while keeping the same level of code simplicity. You'll see what the changed version of the same code looks like in a moment, but first, let's jump ahead and take a look at how different its output is going to be:

<!-- <p>

    </a>
</p>

Looks much faster, doesn't it? Now, back to the code. The full example that uses MiniAgents can be found in [`sequence_flattening.py`](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/blob/main/examples/sequence_flattening.py).

Here are the agent definitions, along with the main execution logic:

```python
# examples/sequence_flattening.py
import asyncio
import random

from miniagents import InteractionContext, Message, MessageSequencePromise, MiniAgents, miniagent


@miniagent
async def research_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    ctx.reply(f"RESEARCHING: {await ctx.message_promises.as_single_text_promise()}")

    for i in range(3):
        # `trigger` returns immediately with a `MessageSequencePromise`.
        # The actual execution of `web_search_agent` starts in the background.
        # `reply_out_of_order` delivers messages as they become available,
        # not strictly in the order they are added to the reply.
        ctx.reply_out_of_order(
            web_search_agent.trigger(
                ctx.message_promises, # Original question
                search_query=f"query {i+1}",
            )
        )


@miniagent
async def web_search_agent(ctx: InteractionContext, search_query: str) -> None:
    ctx.reply(f"{search_query} - SEARCHING")
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1)) # Simulate work
    ctx.reply(f"{search_query} - SEARCH DONE")

    for i in range(2):
        # Again, no `await` here when triggering the next agent.
        # The page_scraper_agent will run in parallel.
        ctx.reply_out_of_order(
            page_scraper_agent.trigger(
                ctx.message_promises, # Original question
                url=f"https://dummy.com/{search_query.replace(' ', '-')}/page-{i+1}",
            )
        )


@miniagent
async def page_scraper_agent(ctx: InteractionContext, url: str) -> None:
    ctx.reply(f"{url} - SCRAPING")
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1)) # Simulate work
    ctx.reply(f"{url} - DONE")


async def stream_to_stdout(promises: MessageSequencePromise):
    """
    As we iterate through the `response_promises` sequence, asyncio switches tasks,
    allowing the agents (`research_agent`, `web_search_agent`, `page_scraper_agent`)

    The `async for` loop seamlessly receives messages from the flattened sequence,
    regardless of how deeply nested their origins were (research_agent ->
    web_search_agent -> page_scraper_agent).
    """
    i = 0
    async for message_promise in promises:
        i += 1
        print(f"{message_promise.message_class.__name__} {i}: ", end="")
        async for token in message_promise:
            print(token, end="")
        print()


async def main():
    """

    response_promises = research_agent.trigger("Tell me about MiniAgents sequence flattening")

    print()

    print()
    print("=== REPLAYING MESSAGES ===")
    # await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    print()

    # If we iterate through the sequence again, we will see that exactly same messages
    # are yielded again (and in exactly the same order). This demonstrates the
    # replayability of all types of promises in MiniAgents.
    #
    # Replayability is useful because it allows you to feed the same same sequences
    # (be it responses from some agents, or an input to the current agent) to
    # multiple other agents without even thinking that those sequences might
    # already be "exhausted" in a traditional, async generator sense.
    await stream_to_stdout(response_promises)

    print()
    print("=== REPLAYING MESSAGES AGAIN ===")
    print()

    # We can even await the whole sequence promise again to get the full list
    # of resolved messages (demonstrating the replayability of promises once again).
    messages: tuple[Message, ...] = await response_promises
    for i, message in enumerate(messages):
        # When you run this example, you will see that for agents replying with
        # simple strings, they are automatically wrapped into TextMessage objects
        # (a subclass of Message).
        print(f"{type(message).__name__} {i+1}: {message}")

    print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The MiniAgents context manager orchestrates the async execution.
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

In the MiniAgents version:
1.  When `research_agent` calls `web_search_agent.trigger(...)`, this call is non-blocking. It immediately returns a `MessageSequencePromise`. The actual execution of `web_search_agent` starts in the background when the asyncio event loop gets a chance to switch tasks.
2.  The `ctx.reply(...)` method (and its variant `ctx.reply_out_of_order(...)`) is versatile. It can accept:
    *   Instances of `Message` (or its subclasses), or other concrete Python objects (like strings, dictionaries, or arbitrary Pydantic models). If not already `Message` objects, these are automatically wrapped into appropriate framework-specific `Message` types (e.g., `TextMessage`).
    *   Promises of individual messages (`MessagePromise`).
    *   Promises that resolve to a sequence of individual message promises (`MessageSequencePromise`), such as those returned by `agent.trigger()`.
    *   Collections (lists, tuples, etc.) containing any mix of the above.
3.  MiniAgents automatically "flattens" this potentially deeply nested structure of messages and promises. When the `main` function (or another agent) consumes the `response_promises` from `research_agent`, it receives a single, flat sequence of all messages. This sequence includes messages produced directly by `research_agent`, all messages from all the triggered `web_search_agent` instances, and consequently, all messages from all the `page_scraper_agent` instances called by them.
    *   _A key aspect to remember is that sequence flattening happens both when you pass input to an agent (which can be concrete messages, promises, or collections of either) and when an agent replies with a promise of a message sequence (`MessageSequencePromise`)._
4.  The `async for message_promise in promises:` loop in the `stream_to_stdout` function in our example (which consumes the results in `main`) leads to asyncio switching tasks. This gives the agents (`research_agent`, `web_search_agent`, `page_scraper_agent`) a chance to run in the background. The use of `reply_out_of_order` in some of the agents ensures that certain messages are yielded to the output stream as soon as they are ready from these parallel operations, rather than in the order in which they were registered as part of the agents' responses. This enhances the sense of parallelism from the consumer's perspective, though it doesn't change the parallelism of the actual agent execution (which is already parallel due to `trigger` being non-blocking).
5.  A key feature highlighted in the `main` function of `sequence_flattening.py` is the **replayability** of `MessageSequencePromise` objects. You can iterate over `response_promises` multiple times and get the exact same sequence of messages. This is invaluable for scenarios where you might want to feed the same set of results to multiple different subsequent processing agents without worrying about "exhausting" the input stream.

As you saw from the animation at the beginning of this section, the processing happens much faster, even though we didn't do anything special to achieve that, all thanks to parallelism introduced by the framework.

This automatic concurrency and sequence flattening greatly simplify the development of complex, multi-step AI systems. You can focus on the logic of each individual agent, writing code that appears sequential within the agent, while the MiniAgents framework handles the parallel execution and complex data flow management behind the scenes.

## Web Research System with real operations

Now that we've explored the core concept of "Message Sequence Flattening" with a dummy example, let's dive into the fully functional Web Research System. This system uses real AI models for understanding and generation, performs actual web searches, and scrapes web pages to gather information.

The complete source code for this example can be found in [`web_research.py`](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/blob/examples/web-research-tutorial/examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py).

### Prerequisites

Before running the `web_research.py` script, you'll need to set up a few things:

1.  **Installation**: First, install MiniAgents and the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -U miniagents openai httpx pydantic markdownify python-dotenv selenium
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:** For the LLM we will use [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and for the google searches as well as web scraping we will use [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/), a pay as you go scraping service. The two Bright Data products that we are interested in are: [SERP API](https://brightdata.com/products/serp-api) and [Scraping Browser](https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser). Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `web_research.py` with the following credentials:

    ```env
    # .env
    BRIGHTDATA_SERP_API_CREDS="your_serp_api_username:your_serp_api_password"
    BRIGHTDATA_SCRAPING_BROWSER_CREDS="your_scraping_browser_username:your_scraping_browser_password"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ```

    ***ATTENTION: The credentials above are NOT for your whole Bright Data account. They are for the SERP API and Scraping Browser respectively (their website will guide you how to set up both products).***

<!-- 3.  **Helper Utilities (`utils.py`):** The project uses a `utils.py` file (available [here](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/blob/main/examples/web_research_tutorial/utils.py)) which contains helper functions for: -->

3.  **Helper Utilities (`utils.py`):** The project uses a `utils.py` file (available [here](https://github.com/teremterem/MiniAgents/blob/examples/web-research-tutorial/examples/web_research_tutorial/utils.py)) which contains helper functions for:
    *   `fetch_google_search()`: Interacts with the Bright Data SERP API.
    *   `scrape_web_page()`: Uses Selenium with Bright Data's Scraping Browser to fetch and parse web page content. It runs Selenium in a separate thread pool as Selenium is blocking.

    You don't need to dive deep into `utils.py` to understand the MiniAgents framework, but it's essential for the example to run.

### System Overview and the `main` function

The entry point of our application is the `main()` function. It orchestrates the entire process:

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Union

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

from miniagents import AgentCall, InteractionContext, Message, MessageSequencePromise, MiniAgents, miniagent
from miniagents.ext.llms import OpenAIAgent, aprepare_dicts_for_openai

from utils import fetch_google_search, scrape_web_page

load_dotenv() # Load environment variables from .env file

MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # "gpt-4o"
SMARTER_MODEL = "o4-mini"  # "o3"
MAX_WEB_PAGES_PER_SEARCH = 2
SLEEP_BEFORE_RETRY_SEC = 5

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()


async def main():
    question = input("\nEnter your question: ")

    # Invoke the main agent (no `await` is placed in front of the call, hence this is a non-blocking operation, no
    # processing starts just yet)
    response_promises: MessageSequencePromise = research_agent.trigger(question)

    print()
    # Iterate over the individual message promises in the response sequence promise. The async loops below lead to task
    # switching, so the agent above as well as its "sub-agents" will now start their work in the background to serve
    # all the promises.
    async for message_promise in response_promises:
        # Skip messages that are not intended for the user (you'll see where the `not_for_user` attribute is set later)
        if message_promise.known_beforehand.get("not_for_user"):
            continue
        # Iterate over the individual tokens in the message promise (messages that aren't broken down into tokens will
        # be delivered in a single token)
        async for token in message_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        print("\n")

# ... (rest of the file)
```

Key takeaways from `main()`:
1.  **Non-Blocking Trigger:** `research_agent.trigger(question)` is called without `await`. This immediately returns a `MessageSequencePromise`, and the `research_agent` (and any agents it triggers) will start processing in the background when the event loop allows.
2.  **Streaming Responses:** The `async for message_promise in response_promises:` loop iterates through the promised messages. Crucially, this loop allows `asyncio` to switch tasks. As messages (or even tokens within messages, if streaming is enabled for an LLM agent) become available from the agent system, they are printed to the console.
3.  **Filtering Messages:** Some messages might be internal to the agent system (e.g., detailed summaries for other agents). We can attach metadata to messages (like `not_for_user`) and use it to filter what's shown to the end-user. The `known_beforehand` attribute of a `MessagePromise` allows access to metadata that is available before the message content itself is resolved. This can be useful for early filtering or routing of messages. In our `main` function, we use this to check the `"not_for_user"` flag (set in `page_scraper_agent`) to prevent internal page summaries from being directly displayed.
4.  **Centralized Output:** Notice that all user-facing output happens here. Agents themselves don't `print`. They communicate results back, which `main` then decides how to present. This separation makes it easier to change the UI or even integrate this entire agentic system as a component within a larger AI system, where its output would be consumed programmatically rather than printed to a console.
5.  **Automatic Background Execution:** MiniAgents, by default, starts processing triggered agents as soon as possible. This is generally the desired behavior for maximum parallelism. While you *can* control this behavior by passing `start_soon=False` to individual `trigger` calls, or by setting `start_everything_soon_by_default=False` in the `MiniAgents` constructor for a global effect, the latter is generally not recommended. Disabling `start_soon` globally can often lead to deadlocks if agent interdependencies are complex, and in the majority of scenarios, there is hardly any benefit in setting `start_soon` to `False`.

### The `research_agent`: Orchestrating the Search

The `research_agent` is the primary coordinator. It takes the user's question and breaks it down into actionable steps.

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (imports and setup shown above) ...

@miniagent
async def research_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    ctx.reply("RESEARCHING...")

    # First, analyze the user's question and break it down into search queries
    message_dicts = await aprepare_dicts_for_openai(
        ctx.message_promises, # The user's question
        system=(
            "Your job is to breakdown the user's question into a list of web searches that need to be done to answer "
            "the question. Please try to optimize your search queries so there aren't too many of them. Current date "
            "is " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        ),

        messages=message_dicts,
        response_format=WebSearchesToBeDone, # Pydantic model for structured output

    parsed: WebSearchesToBeDone = response.choices[0].message.parsed

    _web_search_agent = web_search_agent.fork(
        non_freezable_kwargs={
            "already_picked_urls": already_picked_urls,
        },
    )

    final_answer_call: AgentCall = final_answer_agent.initiate_call(

    )

    for web_search in parsed.web_searches:
        search_and_scraping_results = _web_search_agent.trigger(
            ctx.message_promises, # Forwarding the original user question
            search_query=web_search.web_search_query,
            rationale=web_search.rationale,
        )
        # `reply_out_of_order` sends messages to the research_agent's output
        # as they become available, maintaining responsiveness.
        ctx.reply_out_of_order(search_and_scraping_results)

        # Send the same results to the final_answer_agent
        final_answer_call.send_message(search_and_scraping_results)

    # Reply with the sequence from final_answer_agent, effectively chaining its output
    # to research_agent's output. This also closes the call to final_answer_agent.
    ctx.reply(final_answer_call.reply_sequence())

# ... (other agents)
```

Key aspects of `research_agent`:
1.  **Query Generation:** It uses an LLM (via `openai_client.beta.chat.completions.parse`) to break the user's question into a list of specific search queries. `WebSearchesToBeDone` is a Pydantic model that ensures the LLM returns data in the expected structure (using OpenAI's "structured output" feature). While this example uses the OpenAI client library directly for structured output, MiniAgents plans to support this natively as another built-in LLM mini-agent, along with already existing OpenAIAgent, AnthropicAgent etc. which simply generate text.
2.  **Agent Forking for Configuration and State:** The `web_search_agent` needs to keep track of URLs it has already decided to scrape to avoid redundant work. `agent.fork()` creates a new, independent version (an "instance") of the agent. This is useful for creating agents with specific configurations or, as in this case, for endowing an agent instance with mutable state (like `already_picked_urls`) that is shared across its invocations *by this particular forked instance*. The `non_freezable_kwargs` argument is the mechanism for passing such mutable resources that cannot (or should not) be "frozen" by the fork.
3.  **Initiating Calls (`initiate_call`):** The `final_answer_agent` will eventually synthesize an answer using all gathered information. We don't have all this information upfront. `final_answer_agent.initiate_call()` creates an `AgentCall` object. This allows `research_agent` to send messages (or message promises) to `final_answer_agent` incrementally using `final_answer_call.send_message()`.
4.  **Parallel Fan-Out (`trigger` without `await`):** For each generated search query, `_web_search_agent.trigger()` is called. Again, no `await` means these sub-agents start working in parallel.
5.  **Out-of-Order Replies (`ctx.reply_out_of_order`):** As results from `_web_search_agent` (which include search and scraping steps) become available, `ctx.reply_out_of_order()` sends them to the output stream of `research_agent`. As mentioned earlier, we use `reply_out_of_order()` to avoid enforcing message delivery in the order they were added to the reply. Delivering these messages as soon as they are available allows `research_agent` to show progress from different search branches in real time.
6.  **Chaining Agent Output:** Finally, `ctx.reply(final_answer_call.reply_sequence())` takes the response that `final_answer_agent` will produce (in this example, a sequence consisting of a single message containing the synthesized answer) and appends it to `research_agent`'s own output. `reply_sequence()` also signals to `final_answer_agent` that no more input messages will be sent via `final_answer_call.send_message()`, effectively closing the call (such behavior can be prevented with `reply_sequence(finish_call=False)` if needed, though).

### The `web_search_agent`: Searching and Selecting Pages

This agent takes a single search query, performs the search, and then uses an LLM to decide which of the resulting pages are most relevant for scraping.

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (research_agent) ...

@miniagent
async def web_search_agent(
    ctx: InteractionContext,
    search_query: str,
    rationale: str,
    already_picked_urls: set[str], # Received from the forked instance
) -> None:
    ctx.reply(f'SEARCHING FOR "{search_query}"\n{rationale}')

    try:
        search_results = await fetch_google_search(search_query) # from utils.py
    except Exception:
        await asyncio.sleep(SLEEP_BEFORE_RETRY_SEC)
        ctx.reply(f"RETRYING SEARCH: {search_query}")
        search_results = await fetch_google_search(search_query)

    ctx.reply(f"SEARCH SUCCESSFUL: {search_query}")

    message_dicts = await aprepare_dicts_for_openai(
        [
            ctx.message_promises, # Original user question
            f"RATIONALE: {rationale}\n\nSEARCH QUERY: {search_query}\n\nSEARCH RESULTS:\n\n{search_results}",
        ],
        system=(
            "This is a user question that another AI agent (not you) will have to answer. Your job, however, is "
            "to list all the web page urls that need to be inspected to collect information related to the "
            "RATIONALE and SEARCH QUERY. SEARCH RESULTS where to take the page urls from are be provided to you as "
            "well. Current date is " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        ),
    )
    response = await openai_client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model=SMARTER_MODEL,
        messages=message_dicts,
        response_format=WebPagesToBeRead, # Pydantic model for structured output
    )
    parsed: WebPagesToBeRead = response.choices[0].message.parsed

    web_pages_to_scrape: list[WebPage] = []
    for web_page in parsed.web_pages:
        if web_page.url not in already_picked_urls: # Check against the shared set
            web_pages_to_scrape.append(web_page)
            already_picked_urls.add(web_page.url) # Update the shared set
        if len(web_pages_to_scrape) >= MAX_WEB_PAGES_PER_SEARCH:
            break

    for web_page in web_pages_to_scrape:
        ctx.reply_out_of_order(
            page_scraper_agent.trigger(
                ctx.message_promises, # Original user question
                url=web_page.url,
                rationale=web_page.rationale,
            )
        )

# ... (page_scraper_agent and final_answer_agent)
```

Highlights of `web_search_agent`:
1.  **Actual Web Search:** It calls `fetch_google_search()` (from `utils.py`) to get search results. Includes basic retry logic.
2.  **LLM for Page Selection:** An LLM is prompted to analyze the search results and select promising URLs based on the rationale for the search. The desired output is structured using the `WebPagesToBeRead` Pydantic model.
3.  **Stateful Filtering:** It uses the `already_picked_urls` set (provided by the `fork` in `research_agent`) to avoid re-processing URLs that have already been selected from other search queries in the same overall research task. It also limits the number of pages scraped per search query (`MAX_WEB_PAGES_PER_SEARCH`).
4.  **Parallel Scraping Trigger:** For each selected URL, `page_scraper_agent.trigger()` is called without `await`, initiating parallel scraping operations. Results are again channeled using `ctx.reply_out_of_order()`.

### The `page_scraper_agent`: Fetching and Summarizing Content

This agent is responsible for fetching the content of a single web page and then using an LLM to extract relevant information.

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (web_search_agent) ...

@miniagent
async def page_scraper_agent(
    ctx: InteractionContext,
    url: str,
    rationale: str,
) -> None:
    ctx.reply(f"READING PAGE: {url}\n{rationale}")

    try:
        page_content = await scrape_web_page(url) # from utils.py
    except Exception:
        await asyncio.sleep(SLEEP_BEFORE_RETRY_SEC)
        ctx.reply(f"RETRYING: {url}")
        page_content = await scrape_web_page(url)

    # We await the full summary here because we want to ensure summarization
    # is complete before reporting success for this page.
    page_summary = await OpenAIAgent.trigger(
        [
            ctx.message_promises, # Original user question
            f"URL: {url}\nRATIONALE: {rationale}\n\nWEB PAGE CONTENT:\n\n{page_content}",
        ],
        system=(
            "This is a user question that another AI agent (not you) will have to answer. Your job, however, is "
            "to extract from WEB PAGE CONTENT facts that are relevant to the users original "
            "question. The other AI agent will use the information you extract along with information extracted "
            "by other agents to answer the user's original question later. "
            "Current date is " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        ),
        model=MODEL,
        stream=False, # Streaming isn't critical for this internal summary
        # If summarization fails, let this agent fail rather than sending an error message.
        # This is a choice; for robustness, True might be preferred if partial results are acceptable.
        errors_as_messages=False,
        response_metadata={
            # This summary is for the final_answer_agent, not directly for the user.
            "not_for_user": True,
            # "role": "user", # This metadata might be for other internal tracking
        },
    )
    ctx.reply(f"SCRAPING SUCCESSFUL: {url}")
    ctx.reply(page_summary) # Send the extracted summary

# ... (final_answer_agent)
```

Key points for `page_scraper_agent`:
1.  **Actual Scraping:** It calls `scrape_web_page()` (from `utils.py`), which uses Selenium to get page content. Includes retry logic.
2.  **LLM for Summarization/Extraction:** The MiniAgents built-in `OpenAIAgent` is used here. It's triggered to process the scraped content and extract information relevant to the original user question and the rationale for visiting this specific page.
3.  **Awaiting Specific Results:** Unlike previous `trigger` calls, `page_summary = await OpenAIAgent.trigger(...)` *awaits* the result. This is a design choice: we want to ensure the summarization is complete and successful before this agent reports `SCRAPING SUCCESSFUL` and sends the summary onward.
4.  **Error Handling Choice (`errors_as_messages=False`):** For this particular call to `OpenAIAgent`, `errors_as_messages` is set to `False`. This means if the LLM call fails, the `page_scraper_agent` itself will raise an exception. The overall system is configured with `errors_as_messages=True` (see the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block), so this local override demonstrates fine-grained control. If it were `True` (or defaulted to the global setting), an LLM error would result in an error message being sent as `page_summary` instead of crashing this agent.
5.  **Message Metadata (`response_metadata`):** The `OpenAIAgent.trigger` call includes `response_metadata`. This dictionary is attached to the message(s) produced by `OpenAIAgent`. Here, `"not_for_user": True` signals that this summary is an intermediate result, primarily for the `final_answer_agent`, and shouldn't be directly displayed to the user by the `main` function's loop. _It's worth noting that metadata keys like `"not_for_user"` are arbitrary choices specific to this application's design; you can use any key names that suit your system's logic for routing or annotating messages._

### The `final_answer_agent`: Synthesizing the Result

This agent receives all the summaries and extracted pieces of information from the various `page_scraper_agent` instances and synthesizes a final answer to the user's original question.

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (page_scraper_agent) ...

@miniagent
async def final_answer_agent(ctx: InteractionContext, user_question: Union[Message, tuple[Message, ...]]) -> None:
    # Await all incoming messages (summaries from page_scraper_agents) to ensure
    # they are "materialized" before we proceed to show the "ANSWER" heading. If
    # not for this heading, `await` would not have been important here -
    # OpenAIAgent would have waited for all the incoming messages to make them
    # part of its prompt anyway.
    await ctx.message_promises

    ctx.reply("==========\nANSWER:\n==========")

    ctx.reply(
        OpenAIAgent.trigger(
            [
                "USER QUESTION:",
                user_question, # Passed as a keyword argument during initiate_call
                "INFORMATION FOUND ON THE INTERNET:",
                # Concatenate all received messages (page summaries) into a single text block.
                # `as_single_text_promise()` returns a promise; actual concatenation
                # happens in the background.
                ctx.message_promises.as_single_text_promise(),
            ],
            system=(
                "Please answer the USER QUESTION based on the INFORMATION FOUND ON THE INTERNET. "
                "Current date is " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
            ),
            model=MODEL,
            # stream=True, # OpenAIAgent streams by default, so this is implicitly True.
                           # Explicitly setting stream=False would turn it off.
        )
    )

# ... (Pydantic models and main block)
```

Key features of `final_answer_agent`:
1.  **Waiting for All Inputs (`await ctx.message_promises`):** Before generating the answer, this agent explicitly `await ctx.message_promises`. This ensures that all the page summaries sent by `research_agent` (via `final_answer_call.send_message()`) have arrived and are resolved. This is important because we want the "ANSWER:" heading to appear *after* all the processing logs (like "SEARCHING...", "READING PAGE...").
2.  **Consolidating Information:** `ctx.message_promises.as_single_text_promise()` is a handy method. It takes the sequence of incoming messages (which are the page summaries) and concatenates them into a single text message promise, with original messages separated by double newlines. This consolidated text, along with the original user question, forms the prompt for the final LLM call.
3.  **Generating Final Answer:** `OpenAIAgent` is triggered one last time to produce the comprehensive answer. `OpenAIAgent` streams by default, so the final answer will appear token by token to the user, providing a responsive experience.

### Pydantic Models for Structured LLM Output

Our example uses Pydantic models with OpenAI's "Structured Output" feature (via `response_format` in `client.beta.chat.completions.parse`) to guide the LLM in generating responses in a specific format:

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (final_answer_agent) ...

class WebSearch(BaseModel):
    rationale: str
    web_search_query: str


class WebSearchesToBeDone(BaseModel):
    web_searches: tuple[WebSearch, ...]


class WebPage(BaseModel):
    rationale: str
    url: str


class WebPagesToBeRead(BaseModel):
    web_pages: tuple[WebPage, ...]

# ... (if __name__ == "__main__":)
```

These models (`WebSearchesToBeDone`, `WebPagesToBeRead`) help ensure that the LLM provides its output in a way that can be reliably parsed and used by the subsequent logic in the agents.

### Configuring and Running the System

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block initializes and runs the MiniAgents system:

```python
# examples/web_research_tutorial/web_research.py
# ... (Pydantic models) ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents(
        # Log LLM requests/responses to markdown files in `llm_logs`
        llm_logger_agent=True,
        # Convert agent errors into messages rather than crashing the agents
        errors_as_messages=True,
        # Optionally include full tracebacks in error messages for debugging
        # error_tracebacks_in_messages=True,
    ).run(main())
```

Key `MiniAgents` configurations used here:
*   **`llm_logger_agent=True`**: This is incredibly useful for debugging. It logs all requests to and responses from LLM agents (like `OpenAIAgent`) into markdown files in an `llm_logs` directory. You can inspect these logs to see the exact prompts, model parameters, and outputs.
*   **`errors_as_messages=True`**: This global setting makes the system more robust. If an agent encounters an unhandled exception, instead of the agent (and potentially the whole flow) crashing, the error is packaged into an `ErrorMessage` object and continues through the system. As we saw, `page_scraper_agent` locally overrides this for its LLM calls by setting `errors_as_messages=False` in the `trigger` call.
*   **`error_tracebacks_in_messages=True` (commented out)**: If you enable this, the error messages produced when `errors_as_messages=True` will also include the full Python traceback, which can be helpful during development (only useful when `errors_as_messages=True`, because when `errors_as_messages=False`, errors are raised as exceptions and are logged to the console with the tracebacks regardless of the `error_tracebacks_in_messages` setting).

## Conclusion

This Web Research System demonstrates several powerful features of MiniAgents:
-   **Procedural Code, Parallel Execution:** Agents are written as straightforward async functions, but `trigger` calls without `await` lead to parallel execution.
-   **Promise-Based Communication:** Agents communicate via `MessageSequencePromise` objects, allowing computation to proceed while data is still being gathered.
-   **Sequence Flattening:** Complex, nested calls to agents still result in a single, flat stream of messages for the consumer, managed automatically by the framework.
-   **Flexible Message Handling:** Features like `ctx.reply_out_of_order` for responsive streaming and `agent.initiate_call` for incremental data feeding provide fine-grained control over message flow.
-   **Configurable Agent Instances with Forks:** `agent.fork()` offers a clean way to create isolated, configurable instances of agents, which can be used for managing state specific to a task or for creating differently parameterized versions of an agent.
-   **Native LLM Integration:** The built-in `OpenAIAgent` provides a convenient, MiniAgents-native way to incorporate OpenAI model capabilities into your agents.
-   **Debugging Support:** Features like `llm_logger_agent` aid in development by providing visibility into LLM interactions.
-   **Enhanced Robustness:** Global error handling settings like `errors_as_messages` help create more resilient systems.

By focusing on the logic of individual agents, MiniAgents lets you build sophisticated, concurrent AI systems without getting bogged down in the complexities of manual parallelism management. The system naturally parallelizes IO-bound tasks (like calls to LLMs or external APIs) without requiring explicit concurrency code from the developer, as AI agents are typically IO-bound.
