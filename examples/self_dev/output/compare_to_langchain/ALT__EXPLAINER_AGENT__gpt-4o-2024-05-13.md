========================================
LangChain and MiniAgents are both frameworks designed to facilitate the
development of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). However,
they have different focuses, architectures, and feature sets. Below is a
comparison of the two frameworks based on various aspects:

### Core Focus

- **LangChain**:
    - Primarily focuses on building chains of LLM calls and integrating them
      with various data sources and tools.
    - Emphasizes modularity and composability, allowing developers to create
      complex workflows by chaining together different components.
    - Provides extensive support for various LLM providers, data loaders, and
      tools for tasks like retrieval, summarization, and question answering.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Focuses on building multi-agent systems where agents can communicate
      asynchronously using token and message streaming.
    - Emphasizes immutability and asynchronous processing, with a strong focus
      on token-level streaming between agents.
    - Designed to support complex interactions between multiple agents, making
      it suitable for scenarios where agents need to collaborate or interact in
      real-time.

### Architecture

- **LangChain**:
    - Uses a chain-based architecture where each component in the chain performs
      a specific task and passes the result to the next component.
    - Components can be LLM calls, data loaders, or tools that process the data
      in various ways.
    - Provides a high-level API for defining and managing these chains, making
      it easy to build complex workflows.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Uses an agent-based architecture where each agent is an asynchronous
      function that processes messages and communicates with other agents.
    - Agents can be composed into loops, chains, and other structures to
      facilitate complex interactions.
    - Provides built-in support for token-level streaming, allowing agents to
      process and respond to messages incrementally.

### Message and Token Streaming

- **LangChain**:
    - Primarily focuses on message-level interactions, where each component in
      the chain processes a complete message or document.
    - Does not have built-in support for token-level streaming between
      components.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Designed with token-level streaming as a core feature, allowing agents to
      process and respond to messages incrementally.
    - Supports asynchronous token streaming, making it suitable for real-time
      applications where agents need to interact continuously.

### Integration with LLM Providers

- **LangChain**:
    - Provides extensive support for various LLM providers, including OpenAI,
      Anthropic, and others.
    - Offers built-in integrations with data loaders and tools for tasks like
      retrieval, summarization, and question answering.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Provides built-in support for OpenAI and Anthropic language models, with
      the possibility to add other integrations.
    - Focuses on making it easy to define and manage interactions between
      agents, rather than providing a wide range of integrations out of the box.

### Immutability and Type Safety

- **LangChain**:
    - Does not emphasize immutability or type safety as core features.
    - Focuses more on the flexibility and composability of components.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Emphasizes immutability and type safety, with messages being immutable and
      based on Pydantic models.
    - Ensures that messages and interactions are type-safe and consistent,
      reducing the risk of errors in complex interactions.

### Use Cases

- **LangChain**:
    - Suitable for building complex workflows that involve multiple LLM calls
      and data processing steps.
    - Ideal for applications that require integration with various data sources
      and tools, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

- **MiniAgents**:
    - Suitable for building multi-agent systems where agents need to interact
      and collaborate in real-time.
    - Ideal for applications that require asynchronous token-level streaming and
      complex interactions between agents, such as chatbots, virtual assistants,
      and real-time collaboration tools.

### Example Code Comparison

**LangChain Example**:

```python
from langchain import Chain, LLM, DataLoader

# Define a chain with an LLM call and a data loader
chain = Chain([
    LLM(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", prompt="Summarize the following text: {text}"),
    DataLoader(source="my_database",
               query="SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id = {id}")
])

# Run the chain with input data
result = chain.run({"text": "This is a sample text.", "id": 123})
print(result)
```

**MiniAgents Example**:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext, MiniAgents


@miniagent
async def my_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        ctx.reply(f"You said: {await msg_promise}")


async def main() -> None:
    async for msg_promise in my_agent.inquire(["Hello", "World"]):
        print(await msg_promise)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

### Summary

- **LangChain** is more suitable for building complex workflows involving
  multiple LLM calls and data processing steps, with a focus on modularity and
  composability.
- **MiniAgents** is more suitable for building multi-agent systems with
  asynchronous token-level streaming and complex interactions between agents,
  with a focus on immutability and type safety.

Both frameworks have their strengths and are designed to address different
aspects of working with LLMs. The choice between them depends on the specific
requirements and use cases of your application.
