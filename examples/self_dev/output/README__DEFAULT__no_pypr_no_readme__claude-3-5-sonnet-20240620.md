Here's a clean and informative README.md for the MiniAgents framework:

# MiniAgents

MiniAgents is a powerful and flexible Python framework for building and orchestrating AI agents. It provides a robust foundation for creating, managing, and interacting with various types of agents, including those powered by large language models (LLMs).

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on Python's asyncio, enabling efficient handling of concurrent operations.
- **Flexible Agent System**: Easy creation and management of custom agents with the `@miniagent` decorator.
- **LLM Integration**: Built-in support for OpenAI and Anthropic language models.
- **Message Handling**: Sophisticated message passing and processing capabilities.
- **Promise-based Design**: Utilizes a promise system for managing asynchronous operations and data flows.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended with new agent types and functionalities.

## Core Components

- **MiniAgents**: The main class for managing the context of agent interactions.
- **MiniAgent**: Represents individual agents within the system.
- **Message**: Encapsulates data exchanged between agents.
- **StreamedPromise**: Handles asynchronous data streams.
- **FlatSequence**: Manages sequences of data with flattening capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents, miniagent
from miniagents.messages import Message

@miniagent
async def echo_agent(ctx):
    message = await ctx.messages.aresolve_messages()
    ctx.reply(f"Echo: {message[0].text}")

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        response = echo_agent.inquire("Hello, MiniAgents!")
        print(await response.aresolve_messages())

MiniAgents().run(main())
```

## Advanced Usage

MiniAgents supports complex agent interactions, LLM integration, and customizable message processing. Check out the `examples/` directory for more advanced use cases.
