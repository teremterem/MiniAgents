Here's a clean and informative README.md for the MiniAgents framework:

# MiniAgents

MiniAgents is a Python framework for building and managing AI agents, with a focus on language models and asynchronous operations. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for creating complex agent-based systems.

## Features

- Asynchronous agent interactions
- Support for various language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Flexible message handling and streaming
- Promise-based architecture for efficient async operations
- Extensible agent system with easy-to-use decorators
- Built-in chat history management
- Utility functions for common agent operations

## Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to create and use agents with MiniAgents:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, MiniAgents, InteractionContext
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent

@miniagent
async def user_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    user_input = input("User: ")
    ctx.reply(user_input)

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        assistant = openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
        await assistant.inquire(user_agent)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Components

- `MiniAgents`: The main context manager for managing agent interactions.
- `miniagent`: A decorator for creating agent functions.
- `InteractionContext`: Provides context for agent interactions.
- `Message` and `MessagePromise`: Classes for handling messages and their asynchronous nature.
- `ChatHistory`: Abstract base class for managing chat history.

## Extensions

MiniAgents comes with several extensions:

- OpenAI and Anthropic language model integrations
- Console user agent for interactive sessions
- Markdown-based chat history storage

## Advanced Features

- Promise-based architecture for efficient async operations
- Streaming of message tokens for real-time interactions
- Flexible message joining and splitting utilities
- Singleton metaclasses for global state management
