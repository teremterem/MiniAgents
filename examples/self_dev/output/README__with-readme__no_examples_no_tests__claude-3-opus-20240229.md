# MiniAgents

MiniAgents is an asynchronous framework for building LLM-based multi-agent systems in Python, with a focus on immutable messages and token streaming.

## Features

- Asynchronous and parallel execution of agents
- Define agents as simple Python functions decorated with `@miniagent`
- Agents can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages
- Agents can send and receive messages asynchronously
- Agents can run in parallel and communicate with each other
- Agents can be composed to create more complex agents
- Agents can be chained together to form complex interaction flows
- Promises and async iterators are used extensively to enable non-blocking communication
- Pass messages between agents using `MessageType` objects
- Integrate with OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs using `create_openai_agent` and `create_anthropic_agent`
- Extensible architecture allows integration with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Supports streaming of messages and tokens for efficient processing
- Utilities for working with message sequences (joining, splitting, etc.)
- Stream tokens from LLMs piece-by-piece using `StreamedPromise`
- Flatten nested message sequences with `MessageSequence`
- Promises and async iterators used extensively to enable non-blocking execution
- Immutable message passing via `Frozen` pydantic models
- Frozen data structures for immutable agent state and message metadata
- Immutable message and agent state for reproducibility
- Built on top of the `Promising` library for managing asynchronous operations
- Asynchronous promise-based programming model with `Promise` and `StreamedPromise`
- Hooks to persist messages as they are sent/received
- Typing with Pydantic for validation and serialization of messages

## Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of defining agents and having them interact:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, MiniAgents, InteractionContext

@miniagent
async def agent1(ctx: InteractionContext):
    ctx.reply("Hello from Agent 1!")

@miniagent
async def agent2(ctx: InteractionContext):
    message = await ctx.messages.aresolve_messages()
    ctx.reply(f"Agent 2 received: {message[0].text}")

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        agent2_replies = agent2.inquire(agent1.inquire())
        print(await agent2_replies.aresolve_messages())

asyncio.run(main())
```

This will output:
```
(Message(text='Agent 2 received: Hello from Agent 1!'),)
```

For more advanced usage, including integration with LLMs, see the documentation and examples.

## Documentation

### Core Concepts

- **MiniAgents**: The main class that manages the lifecycle of agents and their interactions.
- **MiniAgent**: A wrapper for an agent function that allows calling the agent.
- **InteractionContext**: Provides context for the interaction, including the messages and the agent.
- **Message**: Represents a message that can be sent between agents.
- **MessagePromise**: A promise of a message that can be streamed token by token.
- **MessageSequencePromise**: A promise of a sequence of messages that can be streamed message by message.

### Core Classes

- `MiniAgents`: The main context manager for managing agents and their interactions.
- `MiniAgent`: A wrapper for an agent function that allows calling the agent.
- `InteractionContext`: Passed to agent functions, provides methods for replying and finishing early

### Message Handling

- `Message`: Represents a message passed between agents
- `MessagePromise`: A promise that resolves to a message
- `MessageSequencePromise`: A promise of a sequence of messages that can be streamed message by message.

### Promising

- `Promise`: Represents a promise of a value that will be resolved asynchronously.
- `StreamedPromise`: Represents a promise of a whole value that can be streamed piece by piece.
- `StreamAppender`: Allows appending pieces to a stream that is consumed by a `StreamedPromise`.

### Utilities

- `achain_loop`: Runs a loop of agents, chaining their interactions.
- `join_messages`: Joins multiple messages into a single message using a delimiter.
- `split_messages`: Splits messages based on a delimiter.

## Things to remember (for the developers of this framework)

- **Different Promise and StreamedPromise resolvers, piece streamers, appenders and what not should always catch
  BaseExceptions and not just Exceptions** when they capture errors to pass those errors as "pieces" in order for
  those errors to be raised at the "consumer side". This is because many of the aforementioned Promising "primitives"
  are often part of mechanisms that involve communications between async tasks via asyncio.Queue objects and just
  interrupting those promises with KeyboardInterrupt which are extended from BaseException instead of letting
  KeyboardInterrupt to go through the queue leads to hanging of those promises (a queue is waiting for END_OF_QUEUE
  sentinel forever but the task that should send it is dead).
