You're right; without a detailed comparison of each feature across all the
mentioned frameworks, it's not possible to definitively state that these
characteristics are unique to MiniAgents. However, based on the typical design
philosophies and documented features of frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph,
Llama-Index, and Haystack-ai, we can make some educated observations:

1. **Asynchronous and Streaming Focus**:
    - **LangChain**: Primarily focuses on chaining language model calls and
      integrating various data sources. It does support asynchronous operations
      but may not emphasize token-by-token streaming as much as MiniAgents.
    - **LangGraph**: Focuses on creating and managing complex workflows
      involving language models. It may support asynchronous operations but
      might not have the same level of focus on streaming.
    - **Llama-Index**: Primarily designed for indexing and querying large
      datasets using language models. It may not emphasize asynchronous token
      streaming.
    - **Haystack-ai**: Focuses on building search systems and pipelines. It
      supports asynchronous operations but may not emphasize token-by-token
      streaming.

2. **Immutable Message Model**:
    - The use of immutable, Pydantic-based messages is a specific design choice
      in MiniAgents. Other frameworks may use different data models and may not
      enforce immutability in the same way.

3. **Flexible Agent Composition**:
    - While other frameworks provide ways to compose and chain operations,
      MiniAgents' approach with the `miniagent` decorator and forking agents is
      a specific design pattern that may not be present in the same form in
      other frameworks.

4. **Low-Level Control**:
    - MiniAgents provides fine-grained control over agent interactions and data
      flow. Other frameworks may offer higher-level abstractions that simplify
      common tasks but may not provide the same level of low-level control.

5. **Promise-based Architecture**:
    - The use of promises for handling asynchronous operations and streaming is
      a specific design choice in MiniAgents. Other frameworks may use different
      mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations.

6. **Built-in Parallelism**:
    - MiniAgents is designed to naturally support parallel execution of agents.
      While other frameworks may support parallelism, the specific design and
      ease of use may differ.

7. **Extensibility**:
    - All the mentioned frameworks are extensible, but the specific mechanisms
      and ease of extending the core functionality may vary.

8. **Lightweight Core**:
    - MiniAgents has a relatively lightweight core focused on essential building
      blocks. Other frameworks may have a larger set of pre-built components and
      integrations, which can add complexity.

9. **Strong Typing**:
    - MiniAgents makes extensive use of Python's type hinting system. Other
      frameworks may also use type hints, but the extent and consistency of
      their use can vary.

10. **Context Management**:
    - The `MiniAgents` context manager provides a clean way to manage the
      lifecycle of agent interactions. Other frameworks may have different
      mechanisms for managing context and resources.

11. **Token-by-Token Streaming**:
    - MiniAgents places a strong emphasis on token-by-token streaming. Other
      frameworks may support streaming but may not emphasize it to the same
      extent.

12. **Git-style Hashing**:
    - The git-style hashing system for messages in MiniAgents is a specific
      feature that may not be present in other frameworks.

To provide a more accurate and detailed comparison, it would be necessary to
conduct a thorough review of the documentation and source code of each
framework. The observations above are based on the general design philosophies
and documented features of the mentioned frameworks as of the last known
information.
