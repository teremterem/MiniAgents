Here are a few key aspects that set the MiniAgents framework apart from other
well-known frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Llama-Index, and Haystack-ai:

1. Focus on asynchronous token and message streaming between agents:
   MiniAgents is built around supporting asynchronous token streaming across
   chains of interconnected agents, making this a core feature of the framework.
   It allows for real-time streaming of tokens and messages between agents,
   enabling more dynamic and interactive agent systems.

2. Flexible message composition and aggregation:
   MiniAgents makes it very easy to combine various types of messages (bare
   strings, messages, message promises, collections, sequences of messages and
   message promises, as well as promises of the sequences themselves) into an
   agent's reply. This entire hierarchical message structure is automatically
   resolved and flattened into a uniform sequence of message promises in the
   background.

3. Unique "start_asap" mode for agent execution:
   By default, agents in MiniAgents work in a "start_asap" mode, which is
   different from the typical coroutine behavior where you need to actively
   await or iterate over them. In this mode, every invoked agent actively seeks
   opportunities to proceed its processing in the background whenever async
   tasks switch. This allows for more autonomous and proactive agent behavior.

4. Immutable, Pydantic-based messages with "replayable" promises:
   Messages in MiniAgents are designed to be immutable once created, using
   Pydantic models. This immutability, combined with the concept of "replayable"
   streamed promises (see StreamedPromise and Promise classes), enables the
   complex asynchronous interactions between agents without concerns about
   message state being modified in the background.

5. Git-style content-based hashing for messages:
   Each message in MiniAgents has a hash_key property that calculates a SHA256
   hash of the message's content. This content-based hashing, similar to Git's
   approach, provides a unique identifier for each message based on its content
   rather than just metadata.

While frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Llama-Index, and Haystack-ai offer
powerful capabilities for building LLM applications, MiniAgents differentiates
itself through its emphasis on asynchronous streaming, flexible message
composition, proactive agent execution, immutable message design, and
content-based hashing. These features make MiniAgents well-suited for building
highly interactive, real-time, and dynamic multi-agent systems with LLMs.
