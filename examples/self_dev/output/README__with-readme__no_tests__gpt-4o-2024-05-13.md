# MiniAgents

MiniAgents is a Python framework designed to facilitate the creation and management of agent-based systems that interact with language models (LLMs) and other services. It provides a structured way to define, call, and manage agents, making it easier to build complex systems that rely on asynchronous interactions and streaming data.

## Why MiniAgents?

The motivation behind MiniAgents is to provide a simple and intuitive way to define agents and their interactions, especially in the context of LLMs. It aims to solve the problem of managing asynchronous and parallel execution of agents, message passing, and integration with various LLM providers.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Interaction**: Support for asynchronous interactions with agents.
- **Streaming**: Stream data token by token or message by message.
- **Parallel Execution**: Agents can run in parallel and communicate with each other.
- **Simple Definition**: Define agents as simple Python functions decorated with `@miniagent`.
- **Message Passing**: Pass messages between agents using `MessageType` objects.
- **Integration with LLMs**: Integrate with OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs using `create_openai_agent` and `create_anthropic_agent`.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Allows integration with various LLM providers.
- **Immutable Message Passing**: Immutable message passing via `Frozen` pydantic models.
- **Promise-Based Programming**: Built on top of the `Promising` library for managing asynchronous operations.
- **Typing and Validation**: Typing with Pydantic for validation and serialization of messages.

## Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example of how to define an agent:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext

@miniagent
async def my_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    async for message in ctx.messages:
        ctx.reply(f"You said: {message}")
```

And here's how to initiate an interaction with the agent:

```python
from miniagents import MiniAgents

async with MiniAgents():
    reply = await my_agent.inquire("Hello!")
    print(reply)  # prints "You said: Hello!"
```

### Advanced Example

For more advanced usage, you can define multiple agents and manage their interactions:

```python
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents, miniagent, InteractionContext

@miniagent
async def agent1(ctx: InteractionContext):
    ctx.reply("Hello from Agent 1!")

@miniagent
async def agent2(ctx: InteractionContext):
    message = await ctx.messages.aresolve_messages()
    ctx.reply(f"Agent 2 received: {message[0].text}")

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        agent2_replies = agent2.inquire(agent1.inquire())
        print(await agent2_replies.aresolve_messages())

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

This will output:
```
(Message(text='Agent 2 received: Hello from Agent 1!'),)
```

### Integrate with LLMs

MiniAgents provides built-in support for OpenAI and Anthropic language models. You can create agents for these models using the provided functions.

#### OpenAI Integration

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import create_openai_agent
from miniagents.messages import Message

openai_agent = create_openai_agent(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        replies = openai_agent.inquire(
            Message(text="Hello, how are you?", role="user"),
            system="You are a helpful assistant.",
            max_tokens=50,
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        async for reply in replies:
            print(await reply)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Anthropic Integration

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.anthropic import create_anthropic_agent

anthropic_agent = create_anthropic_agent()

async def main():
    async with MiniAgents():
        replies = anthropic_agent.inquire("Hello, Anthropic!")
        async for reply in replies:
            print(await reply)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Utility Functions

### Joining Messages

You can join multiple messages into a single message using the `join_messages` function:

```python
from miniagents.utils import join_messages

async def main():
    messages = ["Hello", "world"]
    joined_message = join_messages(messages)
    print(await joined_message.aresolve())

MiniAgents().run(main())
```

### Splitting Messages

You can split a message into multiple messages using the `split_messages` function:

```python
from miniagents.utils import split_messages

async def main():
    message = "Hello\n\nworld"
    split_message = split_messages(message)
    print(await split_message.aresolve_messages())

MiniAgents().run(main())
```

## Core Concepts

- **MiniAgents**: The main context manager for running agents.
- **MiniAgent**: A wrapper for an agent function that allows calling the agent.
- **InteractionContext**: Provides context for the interaction, including the messages and the agent.
- **Message**: Represents a message that can be sent between agents.
- **MessagePromise**: A promise of a message that can be streamed token by token.
- **MessageSequencePromise**: A promise of a sequence of messages that can be streamed message by message.

## Developer Notes

- **Error Handling**: Different Promise and StreamedPromise resolvers, piece streamers, appenders, and other components should always catch `BaseExceptions` and not just `Exceptions` when they capture errors to pass those errors as "pieces". This is because many of the aforementioned Promising "primitives" are often part of mechanisms that involve communications between async tasks via `asyncio.Queue` objects. Interrupting those promises with `KeyboardInterrupt` (which extends from `BaseException`) instead of letting `KeyboardInterrupt` go through the queue leads to hanging of those promises (a queue is waiting for `END_OF_QUEUE` sentinel forever but the task that should send it is dead).
