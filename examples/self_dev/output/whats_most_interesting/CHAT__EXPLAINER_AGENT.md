========================================
One of the most interesting aspects of this repository is the implementation of
the `StreamedPromise` class and the overall asynchronous streaming architecture.
Here are some key points that make it particularly interesting:

1. Asynchronous Token Streaming: The framework is built around supporting
   asynchronous token streaming across chains of interconnected agents. This
   allows for efficient and real-time communication between different components
   of a multi-agent system.

2. Flexible Message Handling: The system can handle various types of messages (
   strings, dicts, Message objects, MessagePromise objects, etc.) and
   automatically flattens them into a uniform sequence of message promises. This
   flexibility makes it easier for developers to work with different data types.

3. `start_asap` Mode: Agents work in a `start_asap` mode by default, which
   allows them to actively seek opportunities to proceed with their processing
   in the background when async tasks switch. This can lead to more efficient
   utilization of resources and faster overall execution.

4. Replayable Streams: The `StreamedPromise` class allows for "replaying" the
   stream of pieces without involving the `streamer` function for the pieces
   that have already been produced. This means that multiple consumers can
   iterate over the stream independently, and each consumer will receive all the
   pieces from the beginning, even if some pieces were produced before the
   consumer started iterating.

5. Immutable Messages: Messages are designed to be immutable once created, which
   helps in maintaining consistency across the system, especially when dealing
   with asynchronous operations.

6. Integration with LLMs: The framework provides built-in support for OpenAI and
   Anthropic language models, making it easy to incorporate these powerful AI
   tools into multi-agent systems.

7. Error Handling: The system has sophisticated error handling mechanisms,
   allowing errors to be captured and propagated appropriately without breaking
   the entire pipeline.

8. Extensibility: The framework is designed to be easily extensible, allowing
   developers to create custom agents and integrate them seamlessly into the
   existing architecture.

These features combine to create a powerful and flexible framework for building
complex, asynchronous multi-agent systems with a focus on efficient
communication and processing. The `StreamedPromise` class, in particular, stands
out as a core component that enables many of these capabilities.
