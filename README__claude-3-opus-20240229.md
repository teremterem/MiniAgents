Here is the improved README.md for the MiniAgents framework:

# 🤖 MiniAgents

An asynchronous framework for building LLM-based multi-agent systems in Python, with immutable messages, Pydantic-based models, and a focus on token and message streaming between agents.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## 📚 Usage

Here's a simple example of how to define an agent:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext, MiniAgents


@miniagent
async def my_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        ctx.reply(f"You said: {await msg_promise}")


async def main() -> None:
    async for msg_promise in my_agent.inquire(["Hello", "World"]):
        print(await msg_promise)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

This script will print the following lines to the console:

```
You said: Hello
You said: World
```

### 🌐 Work with LLMs

MiniAgents provides built-in support for OpenAI and Anthropic language models with the possibility to add other integrations.

⚠️ **ATTENTION!** Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the example below. ⚠️

```python
from miniagents import MiniAgents, Message
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent

# NOTE: "Forking" an agent is a convenient way of creating a new agent instance
# with the specified configuration. Alternatively, you could pass the `model`
# parameter to `openai_agent.inquire()` directly every time you talk to the
# agent.
gpt_4o_agent = openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-4o-2024-05-13")


async def main():
    reply_sequence = gpt_4o_agent.inquire(
        Message(text="How are you today?", role="user"),
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0.0,
        system="Respond only in Yoda-speak.",
    )
    async for msg_promise in reply_sequence:
        async for token in msg_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        print("\n")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

Even though OpenAI models return a single assistant response, the `openai_agent.inquire()` method is designed to return a sequence of messages (which is a sequence of message promises) that can be streamed token by token. This generalizes to arbitrary agents, making agents in the MiniAgents framework easily interchangeable (agents in this framework support sending and receiving zero or more messages).

You can read agent responses token-by-token as shown above regardless of whether the agent is streaming token by token or returning full messages (the complete message text will just be returned as a single "token" in the latter case).

## 📦 Pre-packaged agents (`miniagents.ext`)

⚠️ **ATTENTION!** Make sure to set your Anthropic API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable before running the example below. ⚠️

```python
from miniagents import MiniAgents
from miniagents.ext import dialog_loop, markdown_history_agent
from miniagents.ext.llm import SystemMessage
from miniagents.ext.llm.anthropic import anthropic_agent


async def main() -> None:
    await dialog_loop.fork(
        assistant_agent=anthropic_agent.fork(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            max_tokens=1000,
        ),
        # Write chat history to a markdown file (by default it is `CHAT.md` in
        # the current working directory - "fork" markdown_history_agent to
        # customize).
        history_agent=markdown_history_agent,
    ).inquire(
        SystemMessage(
            "Your job is to improve the styling and grammar of the sentences "
            "that the user throws at you. Leave the sentences unchanged if "
            "they seem fine."
        )
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

Here is what the interaction might look like if you run this script:

```
YOU ARE NOW IN A CHAT WITH AN AI ASSISTANT

Press Enter to send your message.
Press Ctrl+Space to insert a newline.
Press Ctrl+C (or type "exit") to quit the conversation.

USER: hi

ANTHROPIC_AGENT: Hello! The greeting "hi" is a casual and commonly used informal
salutation. It's grammatically correct and doesn't require any changes. If you'd
like to provide a more formal or elaborate greeting, you could consider
alternatives such as "Hello," "Good morning/afternoon/evening," or "Greetings."

USER: got it, thanks!

ANTHROPIC_AGENT: You're welcome! The phrase "Got it, thanks!" is a concise and
informal way to express understanding and appreciation. It's perfectly fine as
is for casual communication. If you wanted a slightly more formal version, you
could say:

"I understand. Thank you!"

USER:
```

### 🛠️ Implementing a custom dialog loop

Here is how you can implement a dialog loop between an agent and a user from the ground up (for simplicity there is no history agent in this example - check out `in_memory_history_agent` and how it is used if you want to know how to implement your own history agent too):

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext, MiniAgents
from miniagents.ext import agent_loop
from miniagents.promising.sentinels import AWAIT


@miniagent
async def user_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        print("ASSISTANT: ", end="", flush=True)
        async for token in msg_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        print()
    ctx.reply(input("USER: "))


@miniagent
async def assistant_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    # Turn a sequence of message promises into a single message promise (if
    # there had been multiple messages in the sequence they would have had
    # been separated by double newlines - this is how `as_single_promise()`
    # by default).
    aggregated_message = await ctx.message_promises.as_single_promise()
    ctx.reply(f'You said "{aggregated_message}"')


async def main() -> None:
    await agent_loop.fork(agents=[user_agent, AWAIT, assistant_agent]).inquire()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

Output:

```
USER: hi
ASSISTANT: You said "hi"
USER: nice!
ASSISTANT: You said "nice!"
USER: bye
ASSISTANT: You said "bye"
USER:
```

The `AWAIT` sentinel is used in the example above to ensure that the `user_agent` completes its processing before the `assistant_agent` starts. This is necessary because the `assistant_agent` needs to receive the user's message before it can generate a response.

The `dialog_loop` agent is a pre-packaged agent that implements a dialog loop between a user agent and an assistant agent. It also supports an optional history agent to keep track of the conversation history.

The `markdown_history_agent` is a pre-packaged agent that logs the conversation history to a markdown file.

Other useful pre-packaged agents include:
- `console_echo_agent`: Echoes messages to the console token by token
- `console_prompt_agent`: Prompts the user for input via the console
- `user_agent`: A user agent that echoes messages from the agent that called it, reads the user input, and returns the full chat history as a reply
- `in_memory_history_agent`: Keeps track of the conversation history in memory

Feel free to explore the source code in the `miniagents.ext` package to see how various agents are implemented and get inspiration for building your own agents!

### 🔀 Agent parallelism explained

```python
from miniagents.miniagents import (
    MiniAgents,
    miniagent,
    InteractionContext,
    Message,
)


@miniagent
async def agent1(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    print("Agent 1 started")
    ctx.reply("*** MESSAGE from Agent 1 ***")
    print("Agent 1 finished")


@miniagent
async def agent2(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    print("Agent 2 started")
    ctx.reply("*** MESSAGE from Agent 2 ***")
    print("Agent 2 finished")


@miniagent
async def aggregator_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    print("Aggregator started")
    ctx.reply(
        [
            agent1.inquire(),
            agent2.inquire(),
            "*** MESSAGE #1 from Aggregator ***",
        ]
    )
    print("Aggregator still working")
    ctx.reply("*** MESSAGE #2 from Aggregator ***")
    print("Aggregator finished")


async def main() -> None:
    msg_promises = aggregator_agent.inquire()

    print("PREPARING TO DELIVER MESSAGES FROM AGGREGATOR")

    async for msg_promise in msg_promises:
        # MessagePromises always resolve into Message objects (or subclasses),
        # even if the agent was replying with bare strings
        message: Message = await msg_promise
        print(message)
    # You can safely `await` again. Concrete messages (and tokens, if there was
    # token streaming) are cached inside the promises. Message sequences (as
    # well as token sequences) are "replayable".
    print("TOTAL NUMBER OF MESSAGES FROM AGGREGATOR:", len(await msg_promises))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

This script will print the following lines to the console:

```
PREPARING TO DELIVER MESSAGES FROM AGGREGATOR
Aggregator started
Aggregator still working
Aggregator finished
Agent 1 started
Agent 1 finished
Agent 2 started
Agent 2 finished
*** MESSAGE from Agent 1 ***
*** MESSAGE from Agent 2 ***
*** MESSAGE #1 from Aggregator ***
*** MESSAGE #2 from Aggregator ***
TOTAL NUMBER OF MESSAGES FROM AGGREGATOR: 4
```

This specific order of print statements is due to the way asynchronous agents are designed in this framework. Notice that you don't see any `await` or `yield` statements in any of the agent functions above. Agent functions are defined as `async`, so you could have `await` statements inside of them for various reasons if you needed to. The agents from the example above just don't need that.

None of the agent functions start executing upon any of the calls to the `inquire()` method. Instead, in all cases the `inquire()` method immediately returns with **promises** to "talk to the agents" (**promises** of sequences of **promises** of response messages, to be super precise - see `MessageSequencePromise` and `MessagePromise` classes for details).

As long as the global `start_asap` setting is set to `True` (which is the default - see the source code of `Promising`, the parent class of `MiniAgents` context manager for details), the actual agent functions will start processing at the earliest task switch (the behavior of `asyncio.create_task()`, which is used under the hood). In this example it is going to be at the beginning of the first iteration of the `async for` loop inside the `main` function.

Keep in mind that this is not specifically because the aforementioned loop is trying to consume the responses that should come from those agents. If there was some other, unrelated task switch before any attempt to consume the responses (let's say `await asyncio.sleep(1)` some time before the loop), the processing of the agent functions would still have started, but now upon this other, unrelated task switch.

⚠️ **ATTENTION!** You can play around with setting `start_asap` to `False` for individual agent calls if for some reason you need to: `some_agent.inquire(request_messages_if_any, start_asap=False)`. However, setting it to `False` for the whole system globally is not recommended because it can lead to deadlocks. ⚠️

Here's a very simple example where you do `miniagent.start_inquiry()` and then do `.send_message()` two times and then call `.reply_sequence()` (instead of the all-in-one `miniagents.inquire()`):

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext, MiniAgents


@miniagent
async def echo_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        ctx.reply(f"You said: {await msg_promise}")


async def main() -> None:
    agent_call = echo_agent.initiate_inquiry()
    agent_call.send_message("Hello").send_message("World")

    async for msg_promise in agent_call.reply_sequence():
        print(await msg_promise)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(main())
```

Output:
```
You said: Hello
You said: World
```

The `MiniAgents()` context can be used in three ways:
1. Calling its `run()` method with your main function as a parameter (as shown in the examples above)
2. Using it as an async context manager:
   ```python
   async with MiniAgents():
       # your code here
   ```
3. Directly calling its `activate()` (and, potentially, `afinalize()` at the end) methods:
   ```python
   mini_agents = MiniAgents()
   mini_agents.activate()
   try:
       # your code here
   finally:
       await mini_agents.afinalize()
   ```

### 💬 Existing Message models

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm import UserMessage, SystemMessage, AssistantMessage

user_message = UserMessage(text="Hello!")
system_message = SystemMessage(text="System message")
assistant_message = AssistantMessage(text="Assistant message")
```

The difference between these message types is in the default values of the `role` field of the message:
- `UserMessage` has `role="user"` by default
- `SystemMessage` has `role="system"` by default
- `AssistantMessage` has `role="assistant"` by default

### 🎨 Custom Message models

You can create custom message types by subclassing `Message`.

```python
from miniagents.messages import Message


class CustomMessage(Message):
    custom_field: str


message = CustomMessage(text="Hello", custom_field="Custom Value")
print(message.text)  # Output: Hello
print(message.custom_field)  # Output: Custom Value
```

## 🤔 Motivation behind this project

There are three main features of MiniAgents that motivated the creation of this framework:

1. It is built around supporting asynchronous token streaming across chains of interconnected agents, making this the core feature of the framework.
2. It is very easy to throw bare strings, messages, message promises, collections, and sequences of messages and message promises (as well as the promises of the sequences themselves) all together into an agent reply (see `MessageType`). This entire hierarchical structure will be asynchronously resolved in the background into a flat and uniform sequence of message promises (it will be automatically "flattened" in the background).
3. By default, agents work in a `start_asap` mode, which is different from the usual way coroutines work where you need to actively await on them and/or iterate over them (in case of asynchronous generators). In `start_asap` mode, every agent, after it was invoked, actively seeks every opportunity to proceed its processing in the background when async tasks switch.

The third feature combines this `start_asap` approach with regular async/await and async generators by using so called streamed promises (see `StreamedPromise` and `Promise` classes) which were designed to be "replayable" by nature.

It was chosen for messages to be immutable once they are created (see `Message` and `Frozen` classes) in order to make all of the above possible (because this way there are no concerns about the state of the message being changed in the background).

The `@MiniAgents().on_persist_message` decorator allows you to persist messages as they are sent/received. Messages (as well as any other Pydantic models derived from `Frozen`) have a `hash_key` property that calculates the sha256 hash of
