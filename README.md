# MiniAgents

A framework on top of asyncio for building LLM-based multi-agent systems in Python, with immutable, Pydantic-based
messages and a focus on asynchronous token and message streaming between agents.

## What was the motivation behind this project?

There are three main features of MiniAgents the idea of which motivated the creation of this framework:

1. It is built around supporting asynchronous token streaming across chains of interconnected agents, making this the
   core feature of the framework.
2. It is very easy to throw bare strings, messages, message promises, collections, and sequences of messages and message
   promises (as well as the promises of the sequences themselves) all together into an agent reply (see `MessageType`).
   This entire hierarchical structure will be asynchronously resolved in the background into a flat and uniform sequence
   of message promises (it will be automatically "flattened" in the background).
3. By default, agents work in so called `start_asap` mode, which is different from the usual way coroutines work where
   you need to actively await on them and/or iterate over them (in case of asynchronous generators). In `start_asap`
   mode, every agent, after it was invoked, actively seeks every opportunity to proceed its processing in the background
   when async tasks switch.

The third feature combines this `start_asap` approach with regular async/await and async generators by using so called
streamed promises (see `StreamedPromise` and `Promise` classes) which were designed to be "replayable" by nature.

It was chosen for messages to be immutable once they are created (see `Message` and `Frozen` classes) in order to make
all of the above possible (because this way there are no concerns about the state of the message being changed in the
background).

**TODO** mention `@MiniAgents().on_persist_message` decorator that allows to persist messages as they are sent/received
and the fact that messages (as well as any other Pydantic models derived from `Frozen`) have `hash_key` property that
calculates the sha256 of the content of the message and is used as the id of the `Messages` (or any other `Frozen`
model) much like there are commit hashes in git.

## Some other features

- Define agents as simple Python functions decorated with `@miniagent`
- Integrate with OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs using `openai_agent` and `anthropic_agent`
- Built on top of the `Promising` library (which is a library built directly inside this library ðŸ™‚) for managing
  asynchronous operations
- Asynchronous promise-based programming model with `Promise` and `StreamedPromise`
- Hooks to persist messages as they are sent/received
- Typing with Pydantic for validation and serialization of messages

## Installation

```bash
pip install miniagents
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to define an agent:

```python
from miniagents import miniagent, InteractionContext, MiniAgents


@miniagent
async def my_agent(ctx: InteractionContext):
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        ctx.reply(f"You said: {await msg_promise}")


async def amain() -> None:
    async for msg_promise in my_agent.inquire(["Hello", "World"]):
        print(await msg_promise)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(amain())
```

This script will print the following lines to the console:

```
You said: Hello
You said: World
```

**TODO** also show an example where you do `miniagent.start_inquiry()` and then do `.send_message()` two times and then
call `.reply_sequence()` (instead of all-in-one `miniagents.inquire()`)

**TODO** show that you can also create a chain of `amain -> my_other_agent -> my_agent` (`my_other_agent` just being a
"transparent" agent that passes messages through without any processing)

**TODO** mention that you can `await` the whole `MessageSequencePromise`, resolving it into a tuple of `Message` objects
this way (give an example)

**TODO** mention three ways MiniAgents() context can be used: calling its `run()` method with your main function as a
parameter, using it as an async context manager or directly calling its `activate()` (and, potentially, `afinalize()` at
the end) methods

### Integrate with LLMs

MiniAgents provides built-in support for OpenAI and Anthropic language models (with possibility to add other
integrations). You can create agents for these models
using the provided functions.

```python
from miniagents import MiniAgents
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent

# NOTE: "Forking" an agent is a convenience method that creates a new agent instance with the specified configuration.
# Alternatively, you could just call `openai_agent.inquire()` directly and pass the model parameter every time.
gpt_4o_agent = openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-4o-2024-05-13")


async def amain():
    reply_sequence = gpt_4o_agent.inquire(
        "Hello, how are you?",
        system="You are a helpful assistant.",
        max_tokens=50,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    async for msg_promise in reply_sequence:
        async for token in msg_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        # MINOR: Let's separate messages with a double newline (even though in this particular case we are actually
        # going to receive only one message).
        print("\n")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(amain())
```

**TODO** explain that even though OpenAI models return a single assistant response, the `openai_agent.inquire()` method
is designed to return a sequence of messages (which is a sequence of message promises) that can be streamed token by
token to generalize to arbitrary agents making agents in the MiniAgents framework easily interchangeable (agents in this
framework support sending and receiving zero or more messages)

**TODO** mention that you can read agent responses token-by-token as shown above regardless of whether the agent is
streaming token by token or returning full messages (the complete message text will just be returned as a single "token"
in the latter case)

## Other pre-packaged agents (`miniagents.ext`)

Here's a simple example of using MiniAgents to create a dialog between a user and an AI assistant powered by OpenAI's
GPT-3.5-turbo model:

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent
from miniagents.ext.misc_agents import console_user_agent
from miniagents.utils import adialog_loop


async def main():
    assistant_agent = openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

    await adialog_loop(console_user_agent, assistant_agent)


asyncio.run(main())
```

This will start an interactive dialog where the user can chat with the AI assistant in the console.

In this example:

1. We take `console_user_agent`, which reads user input from the console and writes back to the console.
2. We create an assistant agent using `openai_agent.fork()`, specifying the OpenAI model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo").
3. We start a dialog loop using `adialog_loop()`, passing the user agent and assistant agent as arguments.
4. The dialog loop runs asynchronously within the `MiniAgents` context, allowing the agents to interact and exchange
   messages.

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example of a conversation using the MiniAgents framework:

```python
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from miniagents.ext.history_agents import ChatHistoryMD
from miniagents.ext.misc_agents import console_user_agent
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents
from miniagents.utils import adialog_loop

load_dotenv()


async def amain() -> None:
    chat_history = ChatHistoryMD("CHAT.md")
    try:
        print()
        await adialog_loop(
            user_agent=console_user_agent.fork(chat_history=chat_history),
            assistant_agent=openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-4o-2024-05-13"),
        )
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
    MiniAgents().run(amain())
```

### Integrating with OpenAI

To create an agent that interacts with OpenAI, you can use the `openai_agent` function:

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent

# Running the OpenAI agent
mini_agents.run(openai_agent.inquire("Hello, OpenAI!"))
```

### Integrating with Anthropic

Similarly, you can create an agent that interacts with Anthropic:

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.anthropic import anthropic_agent

# Running the Anthropic agent
mini_agents.run(anthropic_agent.inquire("Hello, Anthropic!"))
```

### Integrating with OpenAI

You can create an agent that interacts with OpenAI's GPT models:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from miniagents.ext.llm.openai import openai_agent
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents

load_dotenv()

llm_agent = openai_agent.fork(model="gpt-4o-2024-05-13")


async def main() -> None:
    async with MiniAgents():
        reply_sequence = llm_agent.inquire("How are you today?", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.0)
        async for msg_promise in reply_sequence:
            async for token in msg_promise:
                print(token, end="", flush=True)
            print()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Example

For more advanced usage, you can define multiple agents and manage their interactions:

```python
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents, miniagent, InteractionContext
from miniagents.promising.sentinels import AWAIT
from miniagents.utils import achain_loop


@miniagent
async def user_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        async for token in msg_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        print()
    ctx.reply(input("USER: "))


@miniagent
async def assistant_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    async for msg_promise in ctx.message_promises:
        async for token in msg_promise:
            print(token, end="", flush=True)
        print()
    ctx.reply("Hello, how can I assist you?")


async def amain() -> None:
    await achain_loop([user_agent, AWAIT, assistant_agent])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MiniAgents().run(amain())
```

**TODO** explain why AWAIT is used in the example above

The `AWAIT` sentinel is used to ensure that the previous agent's response is fully processed before the next agent
starts.

### Advanced Example with Multiple Agents

You can create more complex interactions involving multiple agents:

```python
import asyncio
from miniagents.miniagents import MiniAgents, miniagent, InteractionContext


@miniagent
async def agent1(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    print("Agent 1 is running")
    ctx.reply("Message from Agent 1")


@miniagent
async def agent2(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    print("Agent 2 is running")
    ctx.reply("Message from Agent 2")


@miniagent
async def aggregator_agent(ctx: InteractionContext) -> None:
    ctx.reply([agent1.inquire(), agent2.inquire()])


async def main() -> None:
    async with MiniAgents():
        await aggregator_agent.inquire()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Message Handling

MiniAgents provides a structured way to handle messages using the `Message` class and its derivatives.

You can create custom message types by subclassing `Message`.

```python
from miniagents.messages import Message


class CustomMessage(Message):
    custom_field: str


message = CustomMessage(text="Hello", custom_field="Custom Value")
print(message.text)  # Output: Hello
print(message.custom_field)  # Output: Custom Value
```

### Handling Messages

MiniAgents provides a structured way to handle messages. You can define different types of messages such
as `UserMessage`, `SystemMessage`, and `AssistantMessage`:

```python
from miniagents.ext.llm.llm_common import UserMessage, SystemMessage, AssistantMessage

user_message = UserMessage(text="Hello!")
system_message = SystemMessage(text="System message")
assistant_message = AssistantMessage(text="Assistant message")
```

**TODO** mention that exceptions in agents are treated as messages ?

For more advanced usage, check out the [examples](examples/) directory.

## Utility Functions

### Joining Messages

You can join multiple messages into a single message using the `join_messages` function:

```python
from miniagents.utils import join_messages


async def main():
    messages = ["Hello", "world"]
    joined_message = join_messages(messages)
    print(await joined_message.aresolve())


miniagents.run(main())
```

### Splitting Messages

You can split a message into multiple messages using the `split_messages` function:

```python
from miniagents.utils import split_messages


async def main():
    message = "Hello\n\nworld"
    split_message = split_messages(message)
    print(await split_message)


miniagents.run(main())
```

## Utilities

MiniAgents provides several utility functions to help with common tasks:

- **join_messages**: Join multiple messages into a single message.
- **split_messages**: Split a message into multiple messages based on a delimiter.

Example of joining messages:

```python
from miniagents.utils import join_messages


async def main():
    async with MiniAgents() as context:
        joined_message = join_messages(["Hello", "World"], delimiter=" ")
        print(await joined_message.aresolve())


MiniAgents().run(main())
```

## Things to remember (for the developers of this framework)

- **Different Promise and StreamedPromise resolvers, piece streamers, appenders and what not should always catch
  BaseExceptions and not just Exceptions** when they capture errors to pass those errors as "pieces" in order for
  those errors to be raised at the "consumer side". This is because many of the aforementioned Promising "primitives"
  are often part of mechanisms that involve communications between async tasks via asyncio.Queue objects and just
  interrupting those promises with KeyboardInterrupt which are extended from BaseException instead of letting
  KeyboardInterrupt to go through the queue leads to hanging of those promises (a queue is waiting for END_OF_QUEUE
  sentinel forever but the task that should send it is dead).

- **Different Promise and StreamedPromise resolvers, piece streamers, appenders, and other components should always
  catch BaseExceptions and not just Exceptions**. This is because many of these components involve communications
  between async tasks via asyncio.Queue objects. Interrupting those promises with KeyboardInterrupt (which extends from
  BaseException) instead of letting it go through the queue can lead to hanging promises.
